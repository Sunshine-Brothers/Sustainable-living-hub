üöÄ Getting Started
To view and run this website locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone or Download the Repository:
If this code is part of a larger Git repository, you would clone it:

Bash

git clone [your-repository-url]
cd sustainable-living-hub
If you just have the index.html file, simply save it to a folder on your computer.

Open the File:
Navigate to the folder where you saved index.html.
Double-click the index.html file.
Your web browser will open the website.

Note: Since this is a static HTML file with external CSS/JS libraries linked via CDN, you don't need a local server to run it.

üì∏ Imagery Strategy
Our visual content is crucial for reinforcing the "Sustainable Living Hub's" mission, especially its relevance to Pakistan. While the current build uses Unsplash placeholders, the plan is to replace them with:

Authentic Pakistani Scenes: Images of local markets, traditional homes, Pakistani landscapes (mountains, rivers, cities), and everyday life.
Real-Life Practices: Photos of Pakistanis engaging in sustainable activities like gardening, composting in urban settings, carrying reusable bags at bazaars, using traditional cooking methods, or participating in clean-up drives.
Culturally Relevant Visuals: Pictures that reflect the diverse cultures and traditions across Pakistan, showing how sustainability integrates with local customs.
Infographics & Illustrations: Custom-designed visuals to explain complex sustainable concepts in an easy-to-understand way, using local examples.
The goal is for every image to resonate with our Pakistani audience, demonstrating that sustainable living is not just a global concept but a tangible and achievable reality within their own context.
